### 20 Games Challenge: 1/20 Pong

## Things Learned
* Setting up input systems for multiplayer (turns out unity doesn't like you sharing a keyboard natively)
* Finding objects that extend an interface using LINQ to call all of the interface specified methods in one loop (IResetable)

* I could use events a lot more in this project to cut down on the number of script references
